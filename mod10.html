	<p> When organizing my various HTML documents, I found the best tool is to name my different files very well. 
	For example, I made sure all of my HTML files and CSS files were clearly labeled by document type, as well as
	their specific page name. With so many different TextWrangler pages, it is easy to get confused. However, by
	properly naming all of my work I was able to continue to navigate my code fairly well. </p>
	
	<p> In maintaining organization through my actual code, I made sure to separate all tags with the proper alignment
	and spacing that would improve readability and allow for quick troubleshooting if some of my codes are broken or 
	not working. In addition, I made sure all of my header, body, and footer tags had distinct white spaces separating 
	them to achieve ease when navigating through my code. I followed this same principle in my CSS files by starting new
	design codes on a new line every time, so the document resembles a neat list. </p>
	
	<p> In the future, to ensure that my markup is free of presentational information I am going to regularly go into my 
	coding and clean up the indents and spaces utilized. When I add new code to my HTML or CSS documents, I sometimes am lazy
	in maintaining organization and presentability. A good practice to enact for the future is to routinely edit my web documents
	and reinsert order in the coding chaos. </p>
