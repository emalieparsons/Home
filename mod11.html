	<h3> Workshop Report </h3>
 		<p>I found my scrum team to be very beneficial when it came to collecting feedback on coding issues, as well as design questions. In my team, I initially had issues with floating images and giving them top, bottom, left, and right margins. I brought this issue to my group whom I discovered had the same issues. Collectively we were able to solve the problem using google, codecademy, and codepen. Next, I submitted a design question to my group: I asked them if using the same header throughout my site was boring and monotonous. While they didn’t immediately shoot down my choice, they advised that multiple headers are more visually appealing. I agreed with them and made the changes. Reversely, my group members asked me for coding help and design advice that I was happy to give. As a group we worked very well together making sure we always listened to each other and were respectful when giving feedback on someone else’s site. </p>
 		<p>During our class time, we immediately got down to business. We began each scrum session by going around the circle to see who had questions or needed help. We worked on each individual problem together until it was resolved before starting a new problem. Each night before class, I went through either my code or my design choices and took inventory of what I needed help with. This way I was organized and ready to use class time efficiently. </p>
 		<p>As previously stated, when we came across a problem especially when coding we used codecademy, google, and codepen as a source. Our method of troubleshooting would first be consulting codecademy if we knew that our problem was previously learned during codecademy tutorials. However, if it was a new problem or new function we would like to use we resorted to google. In this case, we utilized several links that were largely question forums and found our answers in the various write-ins. After finding the answer to our problem we used the new code in codepen to test the code and see if it did in fact pose successful solution. </p>
